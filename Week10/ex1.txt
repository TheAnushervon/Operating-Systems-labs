1) Did the monitor.c program reported an event for myfile11.txt?

Certainly, as myfile11 and myfile1 are hard links. Hard links share the same inode, 
resulting in modifications to one file affecting all the hard links. When we relocate myfile1.txt 
to /tmp/myfile1.txt, the inode remains unchanged.

2) Did the monitor.c program reported an event for myfile11.txt?

No, because myfile1 and myfile13 are symbolic links. Symbolic links, in contrast, 
are distinct entities. Modifying the target file of a symbolic link does not trigger 
events for the symbolic link itself.
